# Password-Checker
A stupid simple password checker that you can use offline to check the strength of a password. This takes into account the complexity, the length, and duplicate characters. No more typing your password into Google or a web form to check how good a password is. Strength is rated on a scale of 0-9, with the higher the number, the stronger the password. 

# Usage
Built for Linux with a shebang, you just give it executable permissions and run the script. No command line arguments for no tracking through bash history.
